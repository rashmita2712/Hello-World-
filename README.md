# Hello-World-
This is a program written in c language for calculating the power loss in a two wire distribution system. If it's assumed that the loads are placed at equal distance so the resistance remains constant. The program requires the value of load current at different loads from the user. The user needs to provide either the value of resistance or maximum voltage drop in the system. The result displayed from this program are the value of resistance, value of maximum voltage drop, total power loss in the system. This gives a simpler approach to calculate the values at a faster rate.
